# Changelog

All notable changes to [TerraNova](https://github.com/HyperSystemsDev/TerraNova) are documented in this file.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Evaluator Overhaul & Schema-Driven Nodes** — Major evaluator rewrite with fixed Shell/YSampled nodes, new MultiMix node, and ingestion of 210+ node definitions from `terranova-bundle.json`. Cross-category connection validation via a 14×14 compatibility matrix, bridge node dual-color headers, drag-target glow/dim suggestions, port tooltips, and fidelity scoring badge
- **Adaptive Voxel Preview** — Auto-fit Y bounds that detect the terrain surface band after the coarse evaluation pass, a "Fit to Content" button that probes the full volume at low resolution, and graph-aware default bounds based on static node type analysis
- **Configuration Dialog** — New Settings > Configuration panel with CPU, GPU, and RAM budget sliders, hardware auto-detection via `sysinfo` crate + WebGL probing, and per-subsystem advanced overrides ([#12])
- **Compound Inputs & Backward Wire Dragging** — Dynamic handle expansion for multi-input nodes (Sum, Product, Min, Max, etc.), backward wire dragging from input ports to QuickAdd dialog, and smart label hiding for generic port names ([#10])
- **Knife Tool** — Cut one or many wires by holding Ctrl+Shift (Cmd+Shift on macOS) and dragging through them, matching Blender/Unreal-style node editor UX ([#17])
- **SVG Export** — Export node graphs as clean, zoomable SVG files via File menu or Ctrl+Shift+G, with scope selection, grid toggle, and presentation/debug modes
- **Accordion Sidebar** — Optional accordion layout as an alternative to the tab bar (Settings > Sidebar), with collapsible drag-to-reorder sections and badge counts

### Fixed

- **Auto-Updater Relaunch** — Overhauled platform-specific relaunch logic with macOS bundle re-signing, Linux execute permission fix, and update loop prevention via localStorage version check
- **SVG 1.1 Compliance** — Replaced rgba(), feDropShadow, 8-digit hex colors, and duplicate XML attributes in exported SVGs for strict parser compatibility (macOS Preview, Inkscape)
- **Undo History Noise** — Node move operations removed from undo history; slider drags now produce exactly one entry on blur instead of spamming during drag

### Changed

- Default world height updated from 256 to 320 to match Hytale's actual limit
- Voxel resolution slider extended to 256 with free typing beyond
- SliderField supports overflow input values beyond the slider range

## [0.1.3] — 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Auto-Updater** — App checks GitHub Releases on launch, notifies in the StatusBar, and applies updates on restart ([#7])
- **Updates Section in Settings** — Current version display, manual "Check for updates" button with feedback toast, and persistent auto-check toggle
- **Dynamic Version Display** — StatusBar now shows live version via `getVersion()` instead of hardcoded `v0.1.0`
- **GitHub Templates** — Issue templates (bug report, feature request) and pull request template
- **Code of Conduct** — `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` added to the repository
- **Design System Reference** — `docs/planning/DESIGN_SYSTEMS.md` documenting the app's visual design system

### Fixed

- **Material Tab Crash** — Opening a blank/void template project no longer crashes the Material tab; guard added against missing material sections ([#6])
- **SimplexNoise2D Settings** — Noise parameters (frequency, amplitude, etc.) now properly propagate to the evaluator and preview ([#8])
- **CI Version Sync** — App version now syncs from the git tag during CI release builds (was always `0.1.0` regardless of release tag)
- **BiomeRangeEditor Redesign** — Overhauled with improved UX, better range management, and cleaner layout

### Changed

- **README.md Overhauled** — Updated screenshots, installation guide, and corrected license to LGPL-2.1
- **Tauri Dependencies Updated** — All `@tauri-apps` npm packages bumped to latest versions
- **Docs Consolidated** — Roadmap and planning documents consolidated and updated; changelog moved to `docs/`

## [0.1.2] — 2026-02-13

Patch release fixing render crashes when opening biome files containing node fields with object values.

### Fixed

- **React Error #31 Crash** — Opening biome files with noise or other nodes containing object-typed field values (e.g. `{x, y, z}` coordinates) caused the editor to crash with "Objects are not valid as a React child" ([#3])
  - Added `safeDisplay` utility that safely converts any field value to a renderable string, applied across all 20 node component files
  - Object values are now JSON-stringified; scalars (numbers, strings) render as before

### Added

- **Node-Level Error Boundary** — `NodeBodyBoundary` inside `BaseNode` catches render errors at the individual node level
  - A single node with bad data now shows an inline error message instead of crashing the entire editor

## [0.1.1] — 2026-02-13

Bug fix release addressing a critical Windows issue where opening biome files caused the entire app to go gray/blank.

### Fixed

- **Windows Biome Gray Screen** — Opening a biome JSON file from the sidebar caused the entire UI to crash to a blank gray screen on Windows ([#2])
  - `isBiomeFile()` path fallback now checks both `/biomes/` and `\biomes\` separators
  - WorldStructure sibling path construction now normalizes backslashes to forward slashes before building the path

### Added

- **Error Boundary** — React `ErrorBoundary` wrapping the main editor panel (`PanelLayout`)
  - If a component throws during render, the crash is contained to the editor area — toolbar and status bar remain visible
  - Displays the error message with a "Try Again" button to recover without restarting the app
- **Blank Project Template** — New project dialog now includes a Blank Project option that scaffolds a minimal `HytaleGenerator` directory structure ([#1])

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-13
