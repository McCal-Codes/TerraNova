## Features

**Node-Based Editor** — Drag-and-drop all 200+ V2 types with category-colored nodes. Auto-layout via dagre, minimap navigation, node search, copy/paste, snap-to-grid, and full undo/redo with descriptive history labels.

**Live Preview** — Real-time 2D heatmaps with contour lines, cross-sections, and position overlays. 3D voxel heightfield preview with SSAO post-processing. Five colormaps (Blue-Red, Grayscale, Terrain, Viridis, Red-Black) with configurable bounds.

**Comparison View** — Side-by-side before/after preview for iterating on terrain changes. See exactly what your edits do without leaving the editor.

**Biome Editor** — Edit Terrain, Material, Pattern, Position, and Prop sections within a single biome file. Per-section undo history, noise range editor for biome boundaries, and a rich dashboard with material layer overview and prop summary.

**Curve Editor** — Interactive canvas with draggable control points for Manual curves. Read-only computed previews for all built-in types (SquareBump, InverseLerp, etc.). Snap-to-grid, interpolation modes, presets, and mini curve previews in node bodies.

**Material Layers** — Visual stack editor for material providers with layer ordering and full V2 SpaceAndDepth specification support.

**Template System** — 10 bundled templates (Void, Forest, Forest Hills, Desert, Mountains, Floating Islands, Eldritch Spirelands, Shattered Archipelago, Tropical Pirate Islands) plus snippet templates for common node patterns. Create and share your own.

**Schema Validation** — Real-time diagnostics on type errors, missing fields, and invalid ranges. Error, warning, and info badges appear directly on nodes so you know exactly what to fix before exporting.

**Bridge Integration** — Connect to a running Hytale server and push exported asset packs directly. Design offline, deploy in one click.

**Full V2 Coverage** — 68 density types, 14 material providers, 19 curves, plus patterns, positions, props, scanners, vectors, environments, assignments, tints, block masks, and world structures.

**Offline-First** — No server, no internet, no telemetry. Under 15MB install. All data stays on your machine.

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/HyperSystemsDev/TerraNova/releases)
2. Open TerraNova, pick a template or start from scratch
3. Design your worldgen using the node editor and live preview
4. Export and drop the JSON files in your server's `mods/` folder

<summary><strong>macOS: App Won't Open / "Unverified Developer"</strong></summary>

TerraNova is not yet signed with an Apple Developer certificate. macOS may block the app on first launch. Use one of these methods:

**Method 1 — Right-click Open (recommended)**
1. Right-click (or Control-click) TerraNova in Applications
2. Select "Open" from the context menu
3. Click "Open" in the dialog that appears

**Method 2 — Terminal command**
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/TerraNova.app
```
Then launch normally.

**Method 3 — System Settings**
1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll to the Security section — you'll see a message about TerraNova being blocked
3. Click **"Open Anyway"**

> These steps are only needed once. Subsequent launches will work normally.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app/) |
| Frontend | [React 19](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) |
| Node Editor | [@xyflow/react](https://reactflow.dev/) (React Flow) |
| 3D Preview | [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/) + [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) |
| State | [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/) |
| Styling | [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) |
| Build | [Vite](https://vite.dev/) with code-split chunks |
| Backend | [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) |
| Noise | [fastnoise-lite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite) |

## Performance

- **O(1) Node Rendering** — `React.memo` with hoisted handle arrays, so only changed nodes re-render (not all 200)
- **Instant Undo/Redo** — History snapshots restored by reference, under 1ms even at 200 nodes
- **Lazy 3D Loading** — Three.js + post-processing (~1.1 MB) loaded on demand, keeping initial load at ~580 KB
- **Bounded Memory** — History caps (50 global / 30 per-section) and LRU file cache eviction (10 files)
- **Chunk Splitting** — Vite splits Three.js, ReactFlow, and dagre into separate chunks for parallel loading

> TerraNova uses [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) instead of Electron — baseline memory is ~80-120 MB (system WebView) vs ~300-500 MB (bundled Chromium).
