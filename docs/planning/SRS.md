## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the software requirements for TerraNova, a standalone desktop design studio for Hytale's World Generation V2 system. It serves as the primary reference for development, testing, and validation.

### 1.2 Scope

TerraNova is a Tauri-based desktop application that provides:
- A visual node graph editor for V2 worldgen asset packs
- Real-time terrain preview via local noise evaluation
- A community template marketplace hosted on GitHub
- Schema validation for V2 JSON assets
- Specialized sub-editors for curves, biome ranges, and material layers

TerraNova does **not**:
- Replace Hytale's built-in editor
- Require a running Hytale server
- Require an internet connection for core functionality
- Generate revenue or collect telemetry

### 1.3 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **V2** | Hytale's World Generation V2 system — asset-driven procedural terrain |
| **Asset Pack** | A directory of JSON files following V2's directory structure (`HytaleGenerator/`) |
| **Density Function** | A node in V2's DAG that produces a scalar value at a 3D position |
| **Node Graph** | Visual representation of a density function DAG (directed acyclic graph) |
| **Template** | A pre-built asset pack bundled or community-shared as a starting point |
| **IPC** | Inter-process communication between the React frontend and Rust backend via Tauri |

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Asset Pack I/O (FR-IO)

#### FR-IO-1: Open Asset Pack
The system shall allow users to select and open a V2 asset pack directory (`HytaleGenerator/`) from the local file system.

**Acceptance:** Selecting a valid directory populates the asset tree sidebar with all JSON files organized by category.

#### FR-IO-2: Parse JSON Assets
The system shall parse all JSON files in the asset pack directory, deserializing them according to V2's polymorphic type system (`"Type"` field dispatch).

**Acceptance:** All known V2 types (200+) are correctly parsed. Unknown types are loaded as raw JSON with a warning.

#### FR-IO-3: Save Asset Pack
The system shall write modified asset data back to JSON files in the original directory structure.

**Acceptance:** Saved JSON is valid, properly formatted (4-space indentation), and loadable by a Hytale server.

#### FR-IO-4: New Project from Template
The system shall create a new asset pack directory from a selected template, copying all template files to the user-specified location.

**Acceptance:** New project directory matches template structure. All files are independent copies (not symlinks).

#### FR-IO-5: File Watching
The system should detect external changes to asset pack files and offer to reload.

**Acceptance:** If a file is modified externally while open, the user receives a notification with reload/ignore options.

### 3.2 Node Graph Editor (FR-NG)

#### FR-NG-1: Custom Node Components
The system shall render custom node components for all V2 asset types, organized by category:

| Category | Types | Node Count |

**Acceptance:** Each type renders as a distinct node with appropriate input/output handles, color coding, and field display.

#### FR-NG-2: Node Palette
The system shall provide a categorized, searchable node palette. Users can drag nodes from the palette onto the canvas or use a keyboard shortcut to add nodes at the cursor position.

**Acceptance:** All 200+ types are browsable by category. Search returns results within 100ms.

#### FR-NG-3: Connection Validation
The system shall validate connections between nodes, ensuring type-safe handles:

- Curve → Curve
- Material → Material
- Pattern → Pattern
- Position → Position
- Scanner → Scanner
- Assignment → Assignment
- Vector → Vector

**Acceptance:** Invalid connections are visually rejected (red highlight, snap-back animation). Valid connections show in the connection's category color.

#### FR-NG-4: Bidirectional Sync
The system shall maintain bidirectional sync between the visual node graph and the underlying V2 JSON:
- **Graph → JSON:** Changes in the node graph produce valid V2 JSON
- **JSON → Graph:** Loading V2 JSON produces an accurate node graph

**Acceptance:** Round-trip test: load JSON → render graph → export JSON → compare with original. All fields preserved.

#### FR-NG-5: Auto-Layout
The system shall provide a one-click auto-layout feature that arranges nodes to minimize wire crossings using a directed graph layout algorithm (dagre or elkjs).

**Acceptance:** Layout produces a readable arrangement for graphs with up to 100 nodes. No node overlaps.

#### FR-NG-6: Undo/Redo
The system shall support undo/redo for all graph operations (add node, delete node, move node, add connection, remove connection, change property value).

**Acceptance:** Ctrl+Z undoes the last operation. Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y redoes. History supports at least 100 operations.

#### FR-NG-7: Minimap
The system shall display a minimap overlay showing the full graph extent with a viewport indicator.

**Acceptance:** Minimap accurately reflects node positions. Clicking the minimap navigates to that area.

#### FR-NG-8: Node Search
The system shall provide a search function (Ctrl+F) to find nodes by type name, display name, or field value.

**Acceptance:** Search highlights matching nodes and allows navigation between results.

#### FR-NG-9: Collapsible Groups
The system shall allow users to select multiple nodes and collapse them into a single group node.

**Acceptance:** Group node shows group name and input/output connections from internal nodes. Expanding restores original layout.

#### FR-PE-2: Density Graph Evaluator
The Rust backend shall evaluate density function DAGs at sample positions:
- Walk the node DAG from output to inputs
- Evaluate each node type with correct semantics
- Handle: noise generators, math ops, clamping, normalizing, coordinate transforms, mixing, warping, shape primitives
- Context-dependent types (Terrain, BaseHeight) return configurable defaults

**Acceptance:** Core density types (30+ of 68) produce correct values. Complex types document their approximation behavior.

#### FR-PE-3: Sample Grid Evaluation
The Rust backend shall evaluate density at an NxN grid of positions and return results as a binary Float32Array via Tauri IPC.

**Acceptance:** Grid sizes from 32x32 to 256x256 evaluate and transfer in <200ms on a modern machine.

#### FR-PE-4: 2D Heatmap Preview
The system shall render a grayscale density heatmap on an HTML Canvas:
- White = high density, Black = low density (or configurable color ramp)
- Updates on slider change (debounced 100ms)
- Configurable sample range (world coordinates)

**Acceptance:** Heatmap reflects density values accurately. Slider changes produce visible preview updates within 200ms.

#### FR-PE-5: 3D Terrain Mesh Preview

- PlaneGeometry with vertex Y displacement from density values
- OrbitControls for camera rotation/zoom/pan
- Configurable resolution (32x32 to 256x256 vertices)
- Wireframe toggle

**Acceptance:** Terrain mesh accurately represents the density function's output as heightfield. Camera controls are smooth.

#### FR-PE-6: Per-Node Preview
The system shall allow clicking any density node to see its isolated output in the preview panel.

**Acceptance:** Clicking a node updates the preview to show that node's output (not the full graph output).

### 3.6 Template System (FR-TS)

#### FR-TS-1: Bundled Templates
The application shall bundle 5 starter templates:

| Template | Description |

- Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 for text on backgrounds

---

## 5. Data Requirements

### 5.1 V2 Schema — Complete Type Definitions

The following types must be represented in both the TypeScript frontend schema and the Rust backend schema.

#### 5.1.1 Root Types

**WorldStructureAsset (NoiseRange)**

| Field | Type | Required | Default |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| `Biomes` | BiomeRangeAsset[] | Yes | — |
| `Density` | DensityAsset | Yes | Constant(0) |
| `DefaultBiome` | string | Yes | — |
| `DefaultTransitionDistance` | int | Yes | 32 |
| `MaxBiomeEdgeDistance` | int | Yes | 0 |
| `Framework` | FrameworkAsset[] | No | [] |
| `SpawnPositions` | PositionProviderAsset | No | List() |

**BiomeRangeAsset**

| Field | Type | Required | Default |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| `Biome` | string (BiomeAsset ref) | Yes | — |
| `Min` | double | Yes | -1.0 |
| `Max` | double | Yes | 1.0 |

**BiomeAsset**

| Field | Type | Required | Default |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| `Name` | string | No | "" |
| `Terrain` | TerrainAsset | Yes | — |
| `FloatingFunctionNodes` | DensityAsset[] | No | [] |
| `MaterialProvider` | MaterialProviderAsset | Yes | — |
| `Props` | PropRuntimeAsset[] | No | [] |
| `EnvironmentProvider` | EnvironmentProviderAsset | No | — |
| `TintProvider` | TintProviderAsset | No | — |

**TerrainAsset (DAOTerrain)**

| Field | Type | Required | Default |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| `Density` | DensityAsset | Yes | Constant(0) |

**PropRuntimeAsset** (wrapper for each Props array entry)

Each entry in the biome's `Props` array is a `PropRuntimeAsset` — a wrapper object that ties together a position provider, assignment chain, and execution phase. This is **not** a typed asset (it has no `Type` field); it is a structural container.

| Field | Type | Required | Default |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| `Runtime` | int | No | 0 |
| `Skip` | boolean | No | false |
| `Positions` | PositionProviderAsset | No | — |
| `Assignments` | AssignmentAsset | No | — |

The `Positions` field is a PositionProviderAsset (e.g., Mesh2D, FieldFunction, DensityBased) that generates candidate XZ coordinates. The `Assignments` field is an AssignmentAsset (e.g., Constant, Weighted, FieldFunction) that selects which Prop to place at each position. Props, Scanners, Directionality, Patterns, and BlockMasks are nested inside the Assignment/Prop hierarchy — not at the PropRuntimeAsset level.

Example from a working biome file:
```json
{
  "Runtime": 0,
  "Skip": false,
  "Positions": {
    "Type": "Mesh2D",
    "PointGenerator": { "Type": "Mesh", "Jitter": 0.5, "ScaleX": 1, "ScaleY": 1, "ScaleZ": 1, "Seed": "A" }
  },
  "Assignments": {
    "Type": "Weighted",
    "SkipChance": 0.5,
    "Seed": "A",
    "WeightedAssignments": [
      {
        "Weight": 5,
        "Assignments": {
          "Type": "Constant",
          "Prop": {
            "Type": "Prefab",
            "WeightedPrefabPaths": [{ "Path": "Trees\\Oak\\Stage_1", "Weight": 1 }],
            "Directionality": { "Type": "Random", "Seed": "A", "Pattern": { ... } },
            "Scanner": { "Type": "ColumnLinear", "MinY": 50, "MaxY": 200, ... }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> **Editor note:** When a biome file is opened in TerraNova, only the `Terrain` subtree (first typed object found) is loaded into the graph editor. Props entries remain in `originalWrapper` as static JSON and are preserved verbatim during round-trip saves.

#### 5.1.1a Hytale-Native vs TerraNova Field Naming

The Hytale in-game editor uses different field names and conventions than TerraNova's V2 abstraction layer. Key differences observed from working biome files:

| Concept | Hytale-Native (in-game) | TerraNova (defaults.ts) |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Noise frequency | `Scale` (higher = larger features) | `Frequency` (higher = smaller features) |
| Noise persistence | `Persistence` | `Gain` |
| Child inputs | `Inputs` array (always) | Named handles: `Input`, `InputA`, `InputB`, `Condition`, etc. |
| Curve mapping | `CurveMapper` | `CurveFunction` |
| Multiplier density | `Multiplier` | `Product` |
| Inverter density | `Inverter` | `Negate` |
| Node IDs | `$NodeId` UUID on every object | Not used (React Flow generates IDs) |
| Curve points | `[{ In: number, Out: number }]` | `[[x, y]]` array pairs |
| Metadata | `$NodeEditorMetadata` with positions, groups | Not stored in JSON |
| Material refs | `{ Solid: "Block_Name" }` object | `"material_name"` string |

> **Note:** TerraNova templates use the TerraNova field naming conventions (as defined in `src/schema/defaults.ts` and `src/nodes/handleRegistry.ts`). When importing/exporting to the Hytale in-game editor, a translation layer will be needed. The type names in Section 5.1.2 below reflect the Hytale-native names from the server documentation.

#### 5.1.2 Density Functions (68 types)

**Common base fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Default |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| `Type` | string | Yes | — |

## 7. Constraints

### 7.1 License
LGPL-2.1 — all code must be compatible with LGPL-2.1 licensing.

### 7.2 Cost
Zero infrastructure cost. All hosting, CI/CD, and distribution must use free tiers (GitHub-only).

### 7.3 Privacy
No telemetry, no analytics, no network requests except:
- Community template index fetch (user-initiated)
- Template downloads (user-initiated)
- Update checks (optional, via Tauri updater against GitHub Releases)

### 7.4 Offline First
Core functionality (editing, preview, validation, bundled templates) must work without any network connection.

### 7.5 Compatibility
Output JSON must be loadable by Hytale server pre-release `2026.02.05-9ce2783f7` without modification.

### 7.6 Open Source
All source code published under LGPL-2.1 license on `HyperSystemsDev/TerraNova` GitHub repository.
