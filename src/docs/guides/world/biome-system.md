# Guide: Biome System

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

This guide explains exactly how biomes are structured, how the world selects which biome applies at each location, and how to configure each of the four systems a biome controls.

---

## What Is a Biome?

A biome is a named asset that bundles four independent systems together. Each system controls a different aspect of the world at that location:

| System | Asset Type | What it controls |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Terrain** | `DensityAsset` | The shape of the land -- hills, cliffs, caves |
| **Material** | `MaterialProviderAsset` | Which block fills each solid voxel |
| **Props** | `PropAsset` + `PositionProvider` | Objects on terrain -- trees, boulders, structures |
| **Environment / Tint** | `EnvironmentProvider` + `TintProvider` | Fog, lighting, and block color tinting |

Each system is **independent** -- you can share a material provider between two biomes with completely different terrain shapes, or give the same terrain density to biomes with different props.

```nodegraph
{
  "height": 220,
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "td",  "label": "Terrain Density",    "category": "terrain",   "sub": "DensityAsset",           "x": 0,   "y": 0   },
    { "id": "mp",  "label": "Material Provider",  "category": "material",  "sub": "MaterialProviderAsset",  "x": 0,   "y": 70  },
    { "id": "pp",  "label": "Props",              "category": "prop",      "sub": "PropAsset + Positions",  "x": 0,   "y": 140 },
    { "id": "ep",  "label": "Environment / Tint", "category": "scanner",   "sub": "EnvironmentProvider",    "x": 0,   "y": 210 },
    { "id": "bio", "label": "Biome",              "category": "biome",     "sub": "BiomeAsset",             "x": 300, "y": 105 }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "from": "td",  "to": "bio", "label": "Terrain" },
    { "from": "mp",  "to": "bio", "label": "Material" },
    { "from": "pp",  "to": "bio", "label": "Props" },
    { "from": "ep",  "to": "bio", "label": "Environment" }
  ]
}
```

## How the World Selects a Biome

At every (x, z) coordinate, the world evaluates a **biome selector density** -- a noise function that outputs a value from -1 to 1. Each biome is assigned a `Min`/`Max` range on that scale. Whichever range the noise value falls into determines the biome for that column.

```json
{
  "Biomes": [
    { "Biome": "Plains",    "Min": -1.0, "Max": -0.3 },
    { "Biome": "Forest",    "Min": -0.3, "Max":  0.3 },
    { "Biome": "Mountains", "Min":  0.3, "Max":  1.0 }
  ],
  "Density": { "Type": "SimplexNoise2D", "Scale": 0.001 },
  "DefaultBiome": "Plains"
}
```

- **`Density`** is any density node -- `SimplexNoise2D` is typical. A low `Scale` (0.001) produces large, gradual biome regions.
- **`DefaultBiome`** is used if no range matches (e.g. exactly on a boundary edge case).
- Ranges should cover the full -1 to 1 span with no gaps.

```nodegraph
{
  "height": 220,
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "sn",  "label": "SimplexNoise2D", "category": "terrain",     "sub": "Scale 0.001",   "x": 0,   "y": 80  },
    { "id": "sel", "label": "Biome Selector", "category": "worldstruct", "sub": "range map",     "x": 220, "y": 80  },
    { "id": "pl",  "label": "Plains",         "category": "biome",       "sub": "-1.0 to -0.3",  "x": 440, "y": 0   },
    { "id": "fo",  "label": "Forest",         "category": "biome",       "sub": "-0.3 to 0.3",   "x": 440, "y": 80  },
    { "id": "mt",  "label": "Mountains",      "category": "biome",       "sub": "0.3 to 1.0",    "x": 440, "y": 160 }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "from": "sn",  "to": "sel", "label": "noise value" },
    { "from": "sel", "to": "pl"  },
    { "from": "sel", "to": "fo"  },
    { "from": "sel", "to": "mt"  }
  ]
}
```

## Biome Transitions

The `DefaultTransitionDistance` field on `World.json` sets how wide the blending zone is between adjacent biomes (in blocks). Within this zone, terrain densities from both biomes are linearly blended.

```json
"DefaultTransitionDistance": 48
```

- Default is **32 blocks** if not specified.
- Larger values produce smoother, wider gradients. Smaller values produce sharper borders.
- Minimum is 1 block (hard cutoff).
- Only **terrain density** is blended -- materials and props each use their own biome's full provider at every point. The visual transition comes from terrain shape blending.

---

## Terrain Density

Each biome has a `Terrain` density function that defines its vertical shape. In the JSON, this is always wrapped in a `DAOTerrain` block — the only registered terrain type — which holds the root `Density` node of your graph.

**Plains** -- gentle rolling surface:
```json
"Terrain": {
  "Type": "DAOTerrain",
  "Density": {
    "Type": "Sum",
    "Inputs": [
      { "Type": "BaseHeight", "BaseHeightName": "surface", "Distance": true },
      { "Type": "SimplexNoise2D", "Scale": 0.01, "Octaves": 4 }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Mountains** -- tall terrain shaped by a curve:
```json
"Terrain": {
  "Type": "DAOTerrain",
  "Density": {
    "Type": "Sum",
    "Inputs": [
      { "Type": "BaseHeight", "BaseHeightName": "surface", "Distance": true },
      { "Type": "CurveMapper", "Input": { "Type": "SimplexNoise2D", "Scale": 0.005, "Octaves": 6 } }
    ]
  }
}
```

Two biomes can share a base structure but differ in parameters — e.g. same noise type, different `BaseHeightName` (which named height they reference) and `Scale`. The `Scale` field on noise nodes controls feature size (lower = broader); `Octaves` controls detail layering.

---

## Material Provider

The `MaterialProvider` determines which block fills each solid voxel. The available types are:

| Type | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `SpaceAndDepth` | Layers by depth below surface -- grass, dirt, stone stacked by thickness |
| `DownwardDepth` | Assigns material based on depth measured downward from the surface |
| `UpwardDepth` | Assigns material based on depth measured upward |
| `DownwardSpace` | Assigns material based on open space measured downward |
| `UpwardSpace` | Assigns material based on open space measured upward |
| `Striped` | Applies a repeating striped material pattern |

**Example -- layered surface with `SpaceAndDepth`:**
```json
"MaterialProvider": {
  "Type": "SpaceAndDepth",
  "LayerContext": "DownwardDepth",
  "Layers": [
    { "Type": "ConstantThickness", "Thickness": 1, "Material": "grass_block" },
    { "Type": "ConstantThickness", "Thickness": 3, "Material": "dirt" },
    { "Type": "ConstantThickness", "Thickness": 99, "Material": "stone" }
  ]
}
```

Layer types inside `SpaceAndDepth`:

| Layer Type | Thickness control |
|-----------|------------------|
| `ConstantThickness` | Fixed number of blocks |
| `NoiseThickness` | Varies by a 2D noise field |
| `RangeThickness` | Random within a min/max range (seeded) |
| `WeightedThickness` | Picks from a list of possible thicknesses by weight |

---

## Props

Props are objects placed on terrain after generation is complete -- trees, boulders, flowers, structures.

Each entry in a biome's `Props` array pairs a **position provider** (where to attempt placement) with a **prop** (what to place). The scanner validates each candidate position against actual terrain before placing.

Props also have a `Runtime` stage integer that controls placement order. Stages are processed in ascending order — earlier stages modify the block grid that later stages check against. The conventional breakdown is:

| Stage | Typical use |
|-------|------------|
| `0` | Large terrain features, boulders — must run first as they modify the grid |
| `1` | Trees, large vegetation, structures |
| `2` | Ground cover, flowers, small decorations |

You can use any integer values; gaps (like `0, 10, 20`) leave room to insert stages later without renumbering.

```json
"Props": [
  {
    "Positions": { "Type": "Mesh2D", "Resolution": 8, "Jitter": 0.5 },
    "Scanner":   { "Type": "ColumnLinear", "StepSize": 1 },
    "Prop": {
      "Type": "Weighted",
      "Entries": [
        { "Weight": 3.0, "Prop": { "Type": "Prefab", "Path": "content/props/oak_tree.json" } },
        { "Weight": 1.0, "Prop": { "Type": "Prefab", "Path": "content/props/birch_tree.json" } }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

**Position provider types** (where to try placing):

| Type | Behavior |
|------|-----------|
| `Mesh2D` | Regular grid of 2D points with optional jitter |
| `Mesh3D` | 3D grid -- for cave props |
| `FieldFunction` | Only keeps positions where a density field exceeds a threshold |
| `Union` | Combines multiple position providers |
| `Offset` | Shifts all positions by a fixed vector |
| `Bound` | Constrains positions to a 3D bounding box |
| `SimpleHorizontal` | Filters positions to a Y range |

**Scanner types** (how placement height is found):

| Type | Behavior |
|------|-----------|
| `ColumnLinear` | Scans downward in linear steps to find the surface |
| `ColumnRandom` | Scans at random Y positions in a range |
| `Origin` | Places directly at the provided position |
| `Area` | Scans a 3D area |

**Prop types** (what gets placed):

| Type | Behavior |
|------|-----------|
| `Prefab` | Places a `.json` prefab asset |
| `Weighted` | Randomly picks from a list of props by weight |
| `Cluster` | Places a group of props together |
| `Column` | Stacks a block material vertically (stalactites, pillars) |
| `Box` | Places a solid box of a material |
| `Density` | Places based on a density field condition |
| `Queue` | Runs a sequence of props |

---

## Environment and Tint

Two separate assets control the visual atmosphere of a biome.

**EnvironmentProvider** -- fog, lighting, sky:

| Type | Behavior |
|------|-----------|
| `Constant` | Fixed environment settings (fog color, density, sun angle) applied throughout the biome |
| `DensityDelimited` | Multiple environment configurations selected by density threshold — e.g. cave atmosphere below Y=40, open sky above |

**TintProvider** -- color tinting on blocks and foliage:

| Type | Behavior |
|------|-----------|
| `Constant` | One color applied everywhere (`Color` field, hex string) |
| `DensityDelimited` | Different tints based on a density boundary — enables gradual color variation within a single biome |

```json
"TintProvider": {
  "Type": "TintConstant",
  "Color": "#6DAF3B"
}
```

---

## Framework System

The `Framework` array in `World.json` defines **named shared assets** that any biome can reference instead of each biome duplicating the same definition. Useful for position providers (tree grids, rock meshes) and decimal constants (sea level, snow line).

### FloatingFunctionNodes and Export/Import

For sharing computed density values *within* a biome (or across biomes), use the **Export/Import** pattern via `FloatingFunctionNodes`. This is a biome-level array of density nodes that are built alongside the biome but are not directly wired into the terrain. Their purpose is to register exported values that other nodes (material providers, props, other biomes) can import by name.

```json
"FloatingFunctionNodes": {
  "height_export": {
    "Type": "Exported",
    "ExportAs": "shared_height",
    "Inputs": { "src": { "Type": "SimplexNoise2D", "Scale": 0.005, "Octaves": 3 } }
  }
}
```

> **Important:** `MaterialProvider` is built *before* terrain density in the biome build sequence. This means a material provider cannot import density values exported by the same biome's `Terrain` node. If you need to share a density between terrain and materials, define it in `FloatingFunctionNodes` instead.

```json
"Framework": [
  {
    "Type": "Positions",
    "Entries": [
      { "Name": "TreeGrid", "Positions": { "Type": "Mesh2D", "Resolution": 8, "Jitter": 0.5 } }
    ]
  },
  {
    "Type": "DecimalConstants",
    "Entries": [
      { "Name": "SeaLevel", "Value": 64.0 }
    ]
  }
]
```

A biome then references `"TreeGrid"` via a `Framework` position provider instead of redefining the mesh. If you change the grid resolution in the Framework, every biome using it updates automatically.

## Summary

1. A **biome selector noise** at low frequency maps each (x,z) column to a biome by range.
2. Each biome owns four independent systems: **terrain density**, **material provider**, **props**, and **environment/tint**.
3. Terrain is always wrapped in a `DAOTerrain` block in JSON; the root `Density` node inside it is your full graph.
4. At biome borders, terrain densities are **blended** over `DefaultTransitionDistance` blocks.
5. Materials use `SpaceAndDepth` for layered surfaces -- grass, dirt, stone stacked by depth.
6. Props pair a **position provider** with a **scanner** and a **prop type** -- placement is validated against real terrain, and `Runtime` stage order controls which props see the block changes of previous stages.
7. Use the **Framework** to share position providers and constants across biomes without duplication.
8. Use **`FloatingFunctionNodes`** with `Exported`/`Imported` to share computed density values between subsystems. Note that `MaterialProvider` is built before terrain density, so material providers must import from floating nodes, not from the terrain graph.
