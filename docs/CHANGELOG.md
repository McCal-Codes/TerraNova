# Changelog

All notable changes to [TerraNova](https://github.com/HyperSystemsDev/TerraNova) are documented in this file.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-02-13

Patch release fixing render crashes when opening biome files containing node fields with object values.

### Fixed

- **React Error #31 Crash** — Opening biome files with noise or other nodes containing object-typed field values (e.g. `{x, y, z}` coordinates) caused the editor to crash with "Objects are not valid as a React child" ([#3])
  - Added `safeDisplay` utility that safely converts any field value to a renderable string, applied across all 20 node component files
  - Object values are now JSON-stringified; scalars (numbers, strings) render as before

### Added

- **Node-Level Error Boundary** — `NodeBodyBoundary` inside `BaseNode` catches render errors at the individual node level
  - A single node with bad data now shows an inline error message instead of crashing the entire editor

## [0.1.1] — 2026-02-13

Bug fix release addressing a critical Windows issue where opening biome files caused the entire app to go gray/blank.

### Fixed

- **Windows Biome Gray Screen** — Opening a biome JSON file from the sidebar caused the entire UI to crash to a blank gray screen on Windows ([#2])
  - `isBiomeFile()` path fallback now checks both `/biomes/` and `\biomes\` separators
  - WorldStructure sibling path construction now normalizes backslashes to forward slashes before building the path

### Added

- **Error Boundary** — React `ErrorBoundary` wrapping the main editor panel (`PanelLayout`)
  - If a component throws during render, the crash is contained to the editor area — toolbar and status bar remain visible
  - Displays the error message with a "Try Again" button to recover without restarting the app
- **Blank Project Template** — New project dialog now includes a Blank Project option that scaffolds a minimal `HytaleGenerator` directory structure ([#1])

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-13

Initial public release. Visual biome editor and terrain designer for Hytale World Generation V2.

Built over 85 commits (Feb 6–13, 2026) in the private TerraNovaDev repository before open-sourcing.

### Core Architecture

- Tauri v2 + React + TypeScript desktop application
- React Flow–based node graph engine with custom node rendering

### Node System

- 50+ Hytale V2 node types across all categories:
  - **Density** — Noise generators (SimplexNoise, CellNoise2D/3D, etc.), math operations (Add, Multiply, Clamp, Blend, Abs, Negate, etc.), shape SDFs
  - **Curve** — Manual editable curves, computed curve types (SquareBump, InverseLerp, etc.)
  - **Material** — Material assignment, layer stacks, SpaceAndDepth specifications
  - **Pattern** — Stripe, checker, gradient patterns
  - **Position** — Position providers, CellNoise-based placement, Point3D/vector nodes
  - **Prop** — Prop placement rules, model references
  - **Scanner** — Column scanner, surface scanner nodes
  - **Vector** — Vector math operations
  - **Environment** — Sky, lighting, fog configuration
  - **Assignment** — Biome assignment and output designation
- Subcategory coloring and palette grouping for density nodes
- Root graph node system with visual dock indicator

### Biome Editor

- Multi-section tabbed editing for biome files (terrain, materials, props, environment)

- Biome range management supporting 5+ biome entries
- Rich dashboard with material layers overview and prop summary

### Curve Editor

- Interactive canvas for Manual curve types with drag-to-edit control points
- Read-only computed curve previews for all built-in types
- Float precision fixes, crosshair overlay, snap-to-grid, interpolation modes, presets
- Mini curve previews in node bodies and property panel
- Editable curve point list with manual coordinate entry

### Material System

- Interactive material layer stack editor
- Full V2 SpaceAndDepth specification support
- Material graph evaluator for density-based material assignment

### Preview Engine

- Density evaluator supporting the full node graph
- Live 2D preview with configurable colormaps and user-controlled bounds
- 3D voxel preview engine with GPU resource management
- Per-node inline density thumbnails
- Diagnostics overlay and image export
- Prop placement visualizer — 2D canvas preview for position providers

### Property Panel

- Slider, toggle, vector, and array field editors
- Input validation and constraint enforcement
- Field descriptions and inline documentation
- Help mode with expanded tips for every field
- Status badges for evaluator completeness

### Import & Export

- Bidirectional Hytale JSON translation layer — import real biome files and export back
- Prefab import/export fidelity with position provider visualization
- Round-trip support preserving all fields through import → edit → export
- CLI export script for batch processing

### Templates

- **Forest Hills** — Starter biome with documented V2 format findings
- **Eldritch Spirelands** — Complex multi-layer biome with full translation layer
- **Shattered Archipelago** — Island terrain with CLI export integration
- **Blank Project** — Empty project with minimal HytaleGenerator structure
- **Quick Start** — Responsive template cards on the home screen
- Snippet templates for common node patterns
- Templates bundled as resources for production builds

### Home Screen

- Bidirectional wire path highlighting with edge hover and input port tracing
- Copy/paste nodes across the graph
- Root node designation with visual feedback
- Centralized keybinding system with configurable shortcuts
- Multi-node selection with context menu actions
- Cursor-tracking quick-add search panel
- Snap-to-grid and alignment tools
- Extended zoom range with scroll-to-zoom
- Replace-on-connect behavior for single-input ports
- Connection validation and cycle detection
- Node visual overhaul — handle positioning, depth styling, edge routing

### UX & Visual Design

- Complete visual redesign with earth/terrain color theme
- Custom app icon
- Per-tab bookmarks and per-file bookmark persistence
- Descriptive history labels with per-section undo history
- Floating view switcher and collapsible preview controls
- Context menus throughout the application
