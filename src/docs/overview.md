# TerraNova Documentation

TerraNova is a community-built visual editor for Hytale WorldGen V2. It gives you a node graph interface to design, preview, and export world generation configurations -- no JSON editing required.

This documentation covers everything from opening the app for the first time to building complex multi-biome worlds with props, caves, and custom terrain shapes.

## What's Here

| Section | What it covers |
|---------|---------------|
| **[Getting Started](./getting-started.md)** | Launching the app, editor layout, keyboard shortcuts |
| **[Walkthroughs](./walkthroughs/README.md)** | Step-by-step tutorials -- follow along in the editor |
| **[Guides](./guides/README.md)** | Concept deep-dives -- terrain generation, biomes, node patterns |
| **[Doc Templates](./templates/README.md)** | Writing templates for guides and walkthrough contributors |
| **[Glossary](./glossary/README.md)** | Definitions for every node type and term |
| **[Reference](./reference/README.md)** | Complete technical listings for nodes, JSON schemas, commands |
| **[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)** | Common problems and how to fix them |
| **[Contributing](./contributing.md)** | How to add guides, fixes, and improvements |

## Which Section Should You Use?

- **Walkthroughs** are for doing. Open one when you want to build something step by step inside TerraNova.
- **Guides** are for understanding. Open one when you want the reasoning, patterns, and tradeoffs behind a system.
- **Reference** is for lookup. Open it when you already know what you want and need exact fields, node behavior, or format details.

If a page mostly tells you "click this, then add this node, then generate," it belongs in **Walkthroughs**. If it explains why curves, biomes, or materials work the way they do, it belongs in **Guides**. If it is mainly facts, options, or schema, it belongs in **Reference**.

## Thank You, Nylaro

A special and sincere thank you to **Nylaro**, whose public Hytale WorldGen V2 guide was the foundation this entire documentation effort is built on. Nylaro took the time to write and share deep technical knowledge about the Hytale worldgen system openly with the community.

The understanding of biome structure, density graphs, material providers, prop placement, and the overall WorldGen V2 architecture in these docs traces directly back to that work. It was an act of genuine generosity to the community, and it is deeply appreciated.

## Thank You, Arisilde

A second major thank you to **Arisilde**, whose *Hytale WorldGen V2 Notes* provided the beginner-accessible foundations for the noise parameter explanations, curve intuition, and troubleshooting content throughout these docs.

Where Nylaro's guide covered the system's architecture, Arisilde's work filled in the "why does this feel confusing" layer — explaining coordinate conventions, the visual mental model of how noise becomes terrain, how curve In/Out values actually relate to world height, seed reuse pitfalls, and common troubleshooting patterns. That work made it significantly easier to write documentation that is actually approachable to visual learners. It is deeply appreciated.
